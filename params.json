{"name":"Viperaccept","tagline":"Static file content negotiation library.","body":"***********\r\nviperaccept\r\n***********\r\n\r\nThis is an application that will perform content negotiation of static\r\nfiles based on the ``Accept*`` HTTP headers either as a library or as a\r\nstand alone WSGI application.\r\n\r\nThis will allow websites to deliver static files without the requirement\r\nof exposing the file extension, language identification, etc. This is\r\nrecommended by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in `Cool URIs don't change <http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI>`_.\r\n\r\nDynamically generated files content negotiation should occur before this\r\napplication is reached.\r\n\r\nIt is highly recommended that this be placed behind a Cache proxy to\r\nreduce the call cost as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.. |date| date:: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z\r\n.. footer::\r\n    | Copyright Â© 2014 Lance Finn Helsten\r\n    | Licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0.\r\n    | Document generated: |date|.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
